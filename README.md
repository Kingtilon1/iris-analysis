# Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`iris_analysis.ipynb`) that performs a detailed analysis of the Iris dataset using machine learning techniques, focusing on the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm. The analysis includes model training, predictions, and evaluations of model performance. The Boston dataset is also used for additional demonstrations.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this notebook, you will need Python and some libraries installed, which include:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/Kingtilon1/iris-analysis.git
cd iris-analysis
\`\`\`

You can install the required packages using:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

Create a \`requirements.txt\` file in the root of your project with the following contents:

\`\`\`
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
\`\`\`

## Running the Analysis

To run the notebook, you will need Jupyter. If you do not have Jupyter installed, you can install it using:

\`\`\`bash
pip install notebook
\`\`\`

After installation, start the Jupyter notebook server:

\`\`\`bash
jupyter notebook
\`\`\`

Navigate to \`iris_analysis.ipynb\` and open it.

## Contents of the Notebook

- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration and visualization of the Iris dataset.
- **Model Training and Prediction**: Using kNN for classification of Iris species.
- **Model Evaluation**: Splitting data into training and testing sets to evaluate the kNN model.
- **Performance Analysis**: Analysis of overfitting and underfitting using the model performance curves.
